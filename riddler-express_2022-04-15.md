**TL;DR: "hire" to "haire" and "our" to "your".**

It turns out, [CMU Pronouncing Dictionary](https://www.nltk.org/_modules/nltk/corpus/reader/cmudict.html) contains many solutions to this week's Riddler Express.

We'll ignore the initialisms and abbreviations, which are unsatisfying answers (e.g., AC to ace, USS to uses, AM to aim). We'll also ignore personal names (e.g., Georgio to Georgiou, Antone to Antoine, Jefferis to Jefferies).

Place names are a little more interesting, but are still unsatisfying:
+ If we count "W" as a vowel, Charleston (chaar-ahls-tahn) to Charlestown (chaarls-tawn)

Some debatable pronunciations:
+ fathering to feathering
+ fondling to foundling

Some unusual but "standard" English words:
+ [beatify](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/beatify#English) to [beautify](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/beautify#English)

Some pretty good answers up for debate:
+ ok to oak

And some truly good answers:
+ hire to haire
+ our to your
